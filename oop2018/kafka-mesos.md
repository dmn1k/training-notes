# Kafka + Mesos

- Kafka: Distributed Commit Log (Replication Factory, configurable scalability)
- can be used for things like log/sensor analysis 
- built for high scale and scalability
- Kafka Connect -> Kafka Cluster -> Kafka Connect
- Kafka Streams uses Kafka Cluster, is part of application
- Confluent builds components around kafka (APIs for multiple languages, REST, Schema Validation, E2E Monitoring, ...)
- All consumers can consume in their pace (when and how often they want)
- Stream Processing: Process data while in motion, no storage before processing
- Spark, Flink: Part of big data cluster, everything has to be deployed there
- Kafka streams is just a library
- Similar operations to flink and spark (map, filter, aggregate, join)
- flink and spark better to process all data at once
- kafka streams includes concept of tables
- KSQL: Streaming query language on top of kafka
- KSQL alternative to custom java code
- KSQL: window über gewissen ausschnitt des streams möglich
- Kubernetes now supported on Mesos
- components on mesos: zookeeper, kafka broker, kafka streams app
- kafka VIP connection: one static url to connect to
- => ny times example for event storage at scale
