# The rational for continuous delivery
*Referent: Dave Farley*

- if sw-projects worked it would be like gaussian distribution
- waterfall misunderstanding (paper)
- need scientific, empirical approach
- Need data, Deming Cycle, Iterative, Lean
- big cycle time -> no feedback
- CD, fast cycle time (60min) even in regulated environment (finance)
- Fast cycle time needs automation, no silos, ...
- you cant prove absence of errors
- every commit is rc
- tests must prove presence of error
- repeatable process => automated, everything in source control
- if it hurts do it more often
- holistic approach
- CI: fast feedback AND high confidence
- sweet spot around 5 mins
- manual testing wasteful, cant get to a level to have really high quality
- automated acceptance testing => Dave Farley Videos
- manual testing good for fuzzy stuff, does it look right, pretty
- dont waste time of humans on release candidates which dont pass acceptance
  tests
- automated perf testin focused and whole system/user interaction based
- "only works in small projects" => google
- "too risky" => amazon
- "only simple projects" => HP LaserJet Firmware team
- Book: A practical approach to large-scale agile development
