# How to build a Corporate Learning Environment and make it work

## Why?

- Only a small fraction of people is actually constantly learning
- Risk from perspective of employer
- Attracts talented people

## What (activities)

- Coding Kata
- Architecture kata
- internal talks by employees
- playground project
- brownbag sessions
- attend outside activities (conferences, MOOCs, ...) and talk about it
- Book discussions
- Mob talk watching and discussion
- Social Skills (training common communication situations)

## How?

- People are different
  - Some have intrinsic motivation => those are easy, just need to be offered
    interesting activities
  - Some dont know where to go => need guidelines, orientation
  - Some dont want to change anything => need extrinsic motivation
  - Some dont know that they are actually interested in stuff like that

- Every group needs to be handled differently
  - Diverse set of offered activities
  - Encourage experimentation
  - Offer extrinsic motivation to some extent
  - Make some activities mandatory for certain groups of people

- On company time (time budget per quarter)
- Optinal by default
- Everyone can join everything (not necessarily what management expects)
- Management at some point expects measurable results (lower turnover-rate,
  increased employee happiness)

## Learnings

- You are competing for peoples time => internal marketing is important
- Session quality is really important especially for the more reserved people
- you cannot please everybody - but should try to please as many people as
  possible

## Keeping it fresh

- Conduct experiments => activities are not set in stone
- Measure: attendance, feedback sheets
- Internal marketing
- Special events (internal conference, tech radar roulette)


## Problems

- Getting people to attend
- Defend orga-time against other stakeholders (superiors)
- Meaningful measurements
- Orga-attachment to certain activities
